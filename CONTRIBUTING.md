# Contributing

Thank you for considering a contribution to the project!

Please review the below guide before creating an issue or pull request.

## Etiquette

This project is open source, and as such, the maintainers give their free time to build and maintain the source code.
They make the code freely available in the hope that it will be of use to other developers. It would not be right for them to suffer abuse or anger for their hard work.

Please be considerate toward maintainers when raising issues or presenting pull requests. Let's show the
world that developers are kind, civilized people.

It's the duty of the maintainer to ensure that all submissions are of sufficient
quality to benefit the project. Many developers have different skillsets, strengths, and weaknesses. Respect the
maintainer's decision, and do not be upset or abusive if your submission is not used.

## Viability

When requesting or submitting new features, first consider whether it might be useful to others. Open
source projects are used by many developers whose needs may differ from your own.

## Procedure

Before filing an issue:

- Attempt to replicate the problem to ensure that it wasn't coincidental.
- Make sure your feature suggestion hasn't already been implemented.
- Check the Pull Requests tab to ensure that the bug doesn't have a fix in progress.
- Check the Pull Requests tab to ensure that the feature isn't already in progress.

Before submitting a pull request:

- Review the codebase to ensure that your feature doesn't already exist.
- Check the Pull Requests to ensure that another person hasn't already submitted the feature or fix.

## Requirements

- Please abide by **[PSR-12 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-12-extended-coding-style-guide.md)**

- **Add tests** - Tests should support whatever new behavior or difference in implementation is proposed.

- **Document any changes in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept
  up-to-date.

- **Follow [SemVer v2.0.0](https://semver.org)** - A breakage of the public API constitutes a new major version.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, submit multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to
  make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please
  consider [squashing them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages)
  before submitting.

**Happy coding, and thank you for your contributions**!
